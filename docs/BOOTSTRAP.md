It is required to manually create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with the following scopes:

- `repo`
- `workflow`
- `read:org`

The token is then stored in `config.sh` as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
